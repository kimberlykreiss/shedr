Description: The package allows users to easily load the public SHED data and

    The functions produce tables and charts that can be found in the report and 
    can be customized for the user's specific analysis. Additionally, it provides 
    a way for the Consumer and Community Research section of DCCA to load the internal
    data easily into R and automate production of tables and charts for the annual report.

# shedr

shedr is an R Package for loading and working with public data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking. It contains code to create analysis and generate the tables and charts that are seen in the annual report. I lead the development of this package in and worked with Lisa Chen, Sara Canilang and Kayla Jones to develop it. I am currently the sole updater and maintainer.

\description{
Data from the 2016 Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economic Decision Making (SHED).
This dataset measures the economic well-being of U.S. households and identifies potential risks to their finances.
The survey includes modules on a range of topics relevant to financial well-being including credit access and behaviors
savings, retirement, economic fragility, and education and student loans. In addition, the survey includes demographic
information about the respondent such as income, race/ethnicity, gender, education and more.

\details{
Description of each variable can be found in the codebook online, at <https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/files/shed_2016codebook.pdf>.

The variable final_weight corresponds to the final weight variable used to match characteristics of the U.S. adult population. For 2016,
final_weight is equal to weight3b, which is scaled to match the number of adults in the United States (population weight). Note that
population weights are available and preferred for the survey starting in 2016, though this will not make a difference for estimates of shares across survey years.
